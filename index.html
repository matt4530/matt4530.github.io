                <h2>History</h2>
                <h5>
                  I started building web and mobile games as part of Profusion Game Development Team from 2009 to 2013, working on titles like Tribulation, 
                  MiniQuest, Ninja Sequence, and Zen Sudoku. I was also interested in web development and worked on sites like FastSWF, a SWF file hosting site.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  After returning from a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I began work as a software engineer and have since returned
                  to Brigham Young University to pursue a PhD, studying how socio-technical systems evolve after a software failure.

                  <p>
                    Profusion Game Development Team Started in mid 2010, with
                    <a href="http://www.davidarcila.com/"
                      >David (Arcano) Arcila</a
                    >. With big ideas, the team launched several web titles
                    before being able to start producing games with much
                    frequency. In 2012, the team published 5 web games and
                    worked on several projects which would launch the next year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team's success started with Tribulation, which has
                    received more than 2 million plays. Zen Sudoku was also a
                    major accomplishment as it was the team's first application
                    for mobile devices built with a responsive display to fit
                    from phones to tablets to web browsers. This game is
                    available on the app store for both Android and iOS devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team's efforts concluded in late 2013 as Matt Pope
                    prepared to serve a full-time mission for The Church of
                    Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Matt now operates
                    Profusion Dev as a personal site.

                I started building websites more than 10 years ago and has

                professional projects.

                  As a self-taught web developer, I has worked on several
                  websites, including FastSWF.com, a file hosting site for game
                  developers and animators working with a file format produced
                  by Adobe Flash. I've led the development and maintenance of
                  ProfusionGames Development Team's website, and their web-game
                  portal in 2012.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Osmond Marketing, I developed and maintained websites in
                  PHP and NodeJS, with content management systems such as
                  wordpress and more. This work involved both front-end and
                  back-end technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Toolkite, I wrote application code that ran on the cloud
                  and helped develop customer facing features. I spent a large
                  amount of time with integrations, helping connect the platform
                  to external APIs such as Etsy, Amazon, and more.

                  This site was the game blog for the Profusion Games
                  Development Team. It also provided an API to allow the game's

                  etc. The site was closed a year after the game development
